            "description": "Collaborative Filtering (CF) based recommenders often exhibit\nmodel biases, delivering strong recommendation utility to certain\nusers or items at the expense of others. Prior research approaches\nthese biases as isolated and standalone issues, ignoring their interconnected nature and developing separate methods, thereby\ncompromising the specialized debiasing efforts. Thus, we introduce\na boosting-based framework designed to alleviate a broad spectrum of biases. This framework employs a series of sub-models,\neach tailored for different user and item subgroups. Theoretically,\nour model ensures an exponentially decreasing upper bound on\nthe training loss across all user and item types with increasing\nboosting iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior debiasing capabilities against state-of-the-art methods across\nfour model bias types.",
